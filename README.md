# Futbot

Welcome to futbot, the chatbot give you relevant updates to the ongoing World Cup of Soccer.

The project is totally open to contributions, message me on discord if you'd like to be added to the project. The outline I've written is intended to be just a start. Please feel free to make any part your own and/or suggest any improvements. 

## Project Goals
1. Learn more on how to collaborate using git
2. Implement Dialogflow api to answer questions about the world cup
3. Practice writing React components
4. Practice writing css
5. ...others?

## Project Structure

### `App.js`
This file will contain the code to interact with the Dialogflow API. React component will be imported from the `Components.js` file to render the API input and output.

*I'm not sure how I'll protect my api key for Diagflow.*

### `Components.js`
I'm guessing that at least 3 components will be needed to create the app:
1. Button - for users to submit their questions
2. DialogBox - a component to render questions and answers
  1. If there's time, it'd be cool to setup a feedback to let users flag weird responses
3. UserInput - an area for users to input their questions
4. ...others??

### `App.css`
Needs to be updated to style the web app. There aren't any id or classNames in the `App.js` or `Components.js` files.

## React Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
